# JaredAcker_Week2_Portfolio

I had a very difficult time with this assignment. I obviously need a lot more practice with css and html.

I couldn't get the images to be the right size and I couldn't get the recent works image block to be closer to the recent works text block. 

I was able to add images, and show my recent works placeholders with the first one being the larger image.

I was also able to make the page adjust sizes based on screen size.

The nav buttons are responsive and go to the corresponding blocked sections below.
